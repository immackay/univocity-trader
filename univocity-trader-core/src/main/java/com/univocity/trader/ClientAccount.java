/**
 * A {@code ClientAccount} implementation controls the account of a user on an exchange or broker,
 * and allows orders to be executed and monitored on behalf of the account holder. Ideally a {@code ClientAccount}
 * instance comes from {@link Exchange#connectToAccount(String, String)}.
 *
 * How a order is processed and tracked depends on an {@link OrderManager}, which receives updates on the order status
 * at frequent intervals and might allow cancellation of the order if it is not filled in a timely manner.
 *
 * The {@link DefaultOrderManager} will be used to handle all orders on all symbols unless the user associates
 * their own implementation to all or some symbols using {@link AccountConfiguration#setOrderManager(OrderManager, String...)}.
 *
 * Note that the {@link DefaultOrderManager} will keep orders open for up to 10 minutes by default, and will cancel the order
 * if it could be filled in full after that time. If the order is cancelled, the account will still retain the amount
 * purchased/sold if the order was {@code PARTIALLY_FILLED}.
